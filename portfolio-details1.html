              <h2>Disruptive Tech (DT) Financing in Africa (Y21-23) <br> Investment Guidance Insights</h2>
              <p>
                The project aims to examine mobilized DT finance in Egypt compared to the Africa Region.<br><br>
                <strong>The Big Four</strong>
                <br> We can not deny the impact that recent developments in ICT and AI has on mobilizing private financing to developing countries in recent years. <br>
                Over Y21-23, Disruptive Tech (DT) private financing amounting to $8.56bn
                 has flowed into Africa. Egypt is one of the 4 crowned king recipients of this financing with $2.01bn.
                 It follows only Nigeria at $2.35bn and is followed by Kenya and South Africa at $1.67bn and $1.31bn, respectively.
                 From a sectoral point of view, 66% of total funding flowed into African Fintech, E-commerce and Energy & Environment sectors at $3.55bn, $1.15bn and $0.96bn, respectively.
                 Meanwhile, out of $2.01bn, Egypt received finance of $1.1bn in Fintech, $0.35bn in E-commerce and $0.17bn in Logistics & Transport.
                 Thus, Fintech was the most funded sector in Egypt and Africa by a large margin.

                <br><br>
                <strong>My Two Cents on Employment:</strong>
                <br>The financed startups reached 1603 in Africa, including 292 in Egypt. Startups reported employing 76,000 people in Africa including a respectable 18,754 in Egypt.<br>
                Egypt's Startups reported an average of 64 employees per startup, which is higher than the African average of 47 employees per startup.
                However, Kenya leads the big 4 as it reports 75 average employees followed by Egypt, Nigeria and finally South Africa at 64, 41, 35.
                The good news: DT startups in Egypt employ a lot people and has the potential to create more jobs in the future.
                However, This tells us nothing about the quality of these jobs, productivity considerations or the wages paid to these employees.
                <br><br>

                <strong>The Bad News:</strong><br>
                For simplicity's sake, let's narrow the comparison to see how Egypt fares in comparison to the other big 3 on the Fintech front - given its weight in the mobilized finance.
                Egypt was financed $1.1bn in Fintech, while Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa were financed $1.34bn, $0.15bn and $0.61bn, respectively.
                Egypt has 61 funded startups; Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa have 204, 59 and 69 funded startups, respectively.
                Average employment per fintech startups in Egypt is 67 - much higher than Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa at 43, 38 and 33, respectively.
                Overall, Egypt has a large concentration of DT finance going to a limited number of fintech startups employing large numbers of people.
                At worst, this could be a sign of inefficient operations or limited productivity. Recent private financing into AI and tech tend to target highly innovative startups which implies lean structures and high productivity.
                Egypt's fintech sector could benefit from diversification and increased competition from other startups leading to spillover effects. The same argument could be made for the e-commerce & retail sector.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Putting the "Angel" in Angel Investor</strong><br>
                Logically, there  are two things investors look for in a startup: growth and profitability. Recently, even private funding is becoming more concerned with social impact and development.<br>
                Now let's turn the entire earlier argument around; when you want to encourage employment and create jobs, do it right!
                Logistics & Transportation is the sector to target in Egypt to have the biggest potential impact on employment and job creation.
                Over the 3 years under study it was funded by $0.17bn with an average of a 120 employees per startup across 27 startups (3240 total employees). An honorable mention goes to Education & Training sector startups.
                
                <br><br>

                <strong>Profitability? We have the next best thing: Sustainability</strong><br>
                For all investors "angels and otherwise", profitability is the name of the game. However, startups are not inclined to share their profitability indicators.
                Best we can do is to look at their sustainability. Even then, I had to create a proxy indicator, namely: average time from Launch to Funding<br>

                In Africa, The most sustainable startups are from the Energy & Environment sector with an average of 5.45 years followed by Agri-tech 4.38 years.
                Sectors which Egypt received $0.01bn, $0.001 in the three years under study. On the front of sustainability, Egypt's startups are also doing well in the Education & Training sector with an average of 4.0 years. The sector attracted a respectable $0.04bn in funding over the study period.
                <br><br>

                <strong>Gender Inclusion? What is Inclusion?</strong>
                <br> Inclusivity is a key concern for investors and policymakers alike. It is a measure of how well the startup ecosystem is able to include all segments of society in its growth and development.<br>
                13% of the total funds were mobilized to female led or managed African DT startups. Only 3% of funds mobilized to Egypt reached femaled led or managed startups.
                This is a clear sign of a lack of inclusivity in the Egyptian startup ecosystem.

                <br><br>

                <strong>Recommendations:</strong><br>
                <br><strong>The analysis leads me to guidance relevant to the Government of Egypt:</strong><br>
                <li>Expand DT Funding Beyond Fintech: Increase support for underfunded sectors like Logistics & Transport and Education & Training to maximize job creation;
                and in Energy & the Environment and Agri-tech for their sustainability.</li>
                <li>Enhance Competition and Innovation: Encourage a broader startup ecosystem by reducing market concentration in a few large firms.</li>
                <li>Address Gender Disparities: Implement policies and incentives to boost funding for female-led startups.</li><br>
                <br><strong>Private Investors Interested in investing in Egypt:</strong><br>
                <li>Diversify Beyond Fintech: Invest in sectors with strong job creation potential, such as Logistics & Transport.</li>
                <li>Drive Efficiency in Fintech: Prioritize innovation-focused startups that enhance productivity and sustainability.</li>
                <li>Promote Female Entrepreneurship: Increase investments in women-led startups to improve inclusivity and market balance.</li>
